## Reflection

This project was challenging primarily due to working with multiple external APIs and ensuring they communicated correctly with the React application. I initially struggled with API responses, especially handling errors and updating the UI based on async data.

Another major challenge was ensuring consistent file naming and casing, which caused issues during development. Fixing these problems improved my understanding of how module resolution works in React and Vite.

Overall, this project helped me become more confident in debugging React applications, structuring components properly, and integrating third-party libraries like Leaflet.
