# Project Reflection

Building the IP Address Tracker project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my understanding of React, API integration, and third-party libraries. I began by setting up the project with Vite and planning the component structure to keep concerns separated and manageable.

One of the main challenges was working with external APIs. Handling asynchronous data, managing loading states, and displaying meaningful error messages required careful state management. Initially, I encountered issues where invalid IP addresses caused the UI to break, which helped reinforce the importance of defensive programming and proper error handling.

Integrating Leaflet was another learning curve. Configuring custom map markers and ensuring the map re-centered correctly when new data was fetched required a deeper understanding of how React Leaflet interacts with the underlying Leaflet instance. Creating a small helper component to recenter the map resolved this cleanly.

Styling the application to match the Frontend Mentor design was also challenging. Translating static design images into responsive CSS required multiple iterations, especially for spacing, typography, and mobile layouts. Media queries and layout testing across screen sizes helped refine the final result.

If I were to continue improving this project, I would explore performance optimizations, add input validation feedback, and potentially refactor styles into a more scalable structure. Overall, this project improved my confidence working with React, APIs, and real-world UI requirements.
