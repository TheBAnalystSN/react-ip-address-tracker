## Project Reflection

This project helped solidify my understanding of React fundamentals, especially component structure, state management, and data fetching using hooks. One of the biggest challenges I faced was integrating external APIs and ensuring the data flowed correctly through the application without causing rendering issues.

Early in development, I encountered several errors related to component imports and file casing, which caused the application to fail silently or render a blank screen. Debugging these issues taught me the importance of consistent naming conventions and careful attention to file paths in React projects.

Another challenge was integrating Leaflet with React. Initially, the map rendered without a marker, which required additional research to understand how Leaflet handles default icons in a module-based environment. Resolving this issue improved my confidence in reading documentation and applying fixes independently.

Overall, this project strengthened my ability to debug React applications, work with third-party libraries, and build a complete, interactive frontend application. Given more time, I would enhance the UI styling and add additional error handling for invalid IP addresses or network failures.
