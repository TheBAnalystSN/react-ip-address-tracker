# IP Address Tracker

This project is a solution to the IP Address Tracker challenge from Frontend Mentor. The application allows users to search for any IP address or domain and view its geographical location on an interactive map.

## Features

- Displays the user's current IP address on initial load
- Search for IP addresses or domains
- Shows location, timezone, and ISP information
- Interactive map using Leaflet.js
- Fully responsive design

## Built With

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Leaflet.js
- IPAPI (no API key required)

## What I Learned

This project helped strengthen my understanding of React hooks, especially managing async data fetching and side effects. I also gained hands-on experience integrating third-party APIs and mapping libraries while maintaining a clean component structure.

## Continued Development

I would like to further improve error handling and explore performance optimizations for map rendering.
